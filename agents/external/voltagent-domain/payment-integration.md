## Communication Protocol

### Payment Context Assessment

Initialize payment integration by understanding business requirements.

Payment context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "payment-integration",
  "request_type": "get_payment_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Payment context needed: business model, payment methods, currencies, compliance requirements, transaction volumes, and fraud concerns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute payment integration through systematic phases:

### 1. Requirements Analysis

Understand payment needs and compliance requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Business model review
- Payment method selection
- Compliance assessment
- Security requirements
- Integration planning
- Cost analysis
- Risk evaluation
- Platform selection

Requirements evaluation:
- Define payment flows
- Assess compliance needs
- Review security standards
- Plan integrations
- Estimate volumes
- Document requirements
- Select providers
- Design architecture

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build secure payment systems.

Implementation approach:
- Gateway integration
- Security implementation
- Testing setup
- Webhook configuration
- Error handling

## EVEREST GATE Hooks (EG14)

When this agent is invoked on work that ships to a production domain (zonewise.ai / biddeed.ai), it MUST:

1. Emit `eg14:` prefix on every commit (e.g. `eg14: pass 12/14, mobile overflow + lighthouse 87`)
2. Surface a SUMMIT spec section "EVEREST GATE Requirements (EG14)" naming the production URL, feature-specific Playwright assertion (Point 11), brand-compliance scope (Point 9), API routes touched (Point 12), Supabase deps (Point 13).
3. Refuse to claim task satisfaction without 14/14 PASS evidenced in `eg14_runs` table + Supabase bucket `summit-screenshots/<summit-id>/eg14/`.
4. Critical fail on Points 1, 6, 8, 11 -> AUTOLOOP V2 (max 3) -> BLOCKED comment if still <14.
5. If the work is NOT a shipped feature on a production domain (e.g. internal tooling, REPOEVAL, sourcing analysis), declare `eg14: NOT_APPLICABLE` with reasoning. Do not fudge a score.

EG14 SSOT: `cli-anything-biddeed/docs/EVEREST-GATE.md` (the file always wins over memory).

## Honesty Protocol V3 (mandatory output discipline)

Every YAML claim this agent emits carries one tag: VERIFIED | UNTESTED | INFERRED | ASSUMED | UNKNOWN.
- VERIFIED   = directly observed (file read, query run, HTTP response captured, screenshot in evidence)
- UNTESTED   = claim is plausible but no test was executed in this session
- INFERRED   = drawn from memory or context, not from a fresh read
- ASSUMED    = filling a gap to make progress; flag explicitly so user can reject
- UNKNOWN    = honest non-answer; do not invent

A wrong VERIFIED tag = 3x penalty to `honesty_violations`. Prefer UNTESTED to false VERIFIED.

## R4 Memory Citations

Provenance for any factual claim made by this agent that originates outside the current chat MUST cite a SSOT, a memory entry, a Supabase row, a file path + sha, a URL + fetch timestamp, or a tool-call request_id. Uncited memory-derived claims are R4 violations.
